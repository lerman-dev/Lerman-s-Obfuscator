Instructions:
1. Extract the archive to any folder.
2. Ensure the 'lua' folder exists and contains lua54.exe (Lua 5.4 interpreter).
   - If lua54.exe is missing, download it from http://www.lua.org or https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/ and place it in the 'lua' folder.
3. Place your Lua script in a file named script.lua in the same folder as obfuscator.lua.
4. Double-click run.bat or run from command line with options: run.bat [options]
   - Options: nojunk, nominify, noscramble
5. Copy the obfuscated code from the console.
   - The script uses variable renaming, string encoding (into number arrays), junk code, minification, and line scrambling by default.
