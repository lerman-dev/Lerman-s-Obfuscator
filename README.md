## Features

- Line scrambling

## Installation
1. Extract the archive to any folder.
2. Ensure the `lua` folder exists and contains `lua54.exe` (Lua 5.4 interpreter).
   - If `lua54.exe` is missing, download it from [http://www.lua.org](http://www.lua.org) or [https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/luabinaries/) and place it in the `lua` folder.
3. Place your Lua script in a file named `script.lua` in the same folder as `obfuscator.lua`.

## Usage
1. Double-click `Start.bat` or run from the command line.
2. The obfuscator will automatically read and obfuscate the script from `script.lua`.
3. Copy the obfuscated code from the console.

## Notes
- The script uses variable renaming, string encoding, junk code, minification, and line scrambling by default.
- If `script.lua` is not found or is empty, an error will be displayed.
